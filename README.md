# How to think in code

This 2-hour workshop is part of the McGill Initiative of Computational Medicine (MiCM) workshop series. In this session we will introduce the world of programming to complete beginners. The first part consists of getting familiar with basic programming concepts such as variables, algorithms, and data structures. The second part focuses on finding solutions to simple coding questions, breaking them down into a logical set of steps, and then expressing them in a structured way.

At the end of this workshop, participants will:

1. Understand basic programming terminology (code, variables, algorithms, data structures)
2. Become familiar with programming logic
3. Practice structured thinking for programming

Prerequisites:

- Have basic mathematical knowledge (number properties, linear algebra, and equations)
- Create an account in https://brilliant.org for the hands-on parts (the free version is enough)
